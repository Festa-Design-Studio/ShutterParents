# Color Usage

### Minimum Color

_**“Bite My Tongue”**_ is our primary brand color, and it plays a significant role in the way our brand is perceived. Its dominant use seeks to uphold the brand’s identity, adherence to which would maintain our brand’s strong visual coherence

### Medium color

For more functional pieces like the brochure, we use a reduced palette. _**“Bite My Tongue”**_ and _**“Fizzy Peach”**_ work as the base to enhance clarity and legibility.
